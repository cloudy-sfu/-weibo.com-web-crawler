## Debug

**Linux system**

You should get cookies with Google Chrome in Windows. After finishing `login_windows.py`, you can copy this program **and the generated database** to a Linux machine and retrieve posts before the cookies expire.

Contribution is open to Linux and other operation systems and browsers' login scripts.

**Reasons for empty results**

1. Searching non-Chinese strings will usually return nothing, because "Weibo" is a Chinese social media. 
2. There are several hours' delay before posts appear in the search engine. It's better to search posts 2 days ago.

## Install

If it's the first time to use this program, please create a Python virtual environment and run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the minimum example, I assume the computer has installed Google Chrome in the default path. If Google Chrome is installed, but in the customized path, please run the following command and set `chrome_user_data` manually.

## Usage

Run `python login_windows.py` and follow the instructions in the command line. This step requires a graphic operation system, because the user have to open a web browser and login "weibo". Other steps can be implemented in a non-graphic operation system.

> [!NOTE]
>
> For example, to search posts containing "GitHub" at 11:00-12:00 (UTC+8) on August 15, 2023. Retrieve at most 2 pages (10 posts per page).
>
> ```bash
> python search.py --query="GitHub" --start_time=2023-08-15-11 --end_time=2023-08-15-12 --max_page=2
> ```
>
> For more search options, run the following command.
>
> ```bash
> python search.py --help
> ```

If the database path is by default, the results are saved in `posts.db` database.

View the `search` table and get the table name. The data structure is shown as follows.
